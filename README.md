# 🚀 SEO & AEO Case Study: Australian HVAC & Refrigeration

### Transformative Organic Growth through AI-Integrated Search Strategy

## 📋 Project Overview
* **Sector:** Australian HVAC & Refrigeration
* **Timeline:** 6-Month AI-Integrated Campaign
* **Market Focus:** Toowoomba, QLD
* **Core Objective:** Pivot from low visibility to high-intent lead capture by dominating "Answer Engine" results.

---

## 📉 The Challenge
Prior to the campaign, the client suffered from a "Page 2 ghost town" effect:
* **Average Position:** 16.4 (stuck on Page 2).
* **Visibility Gap:** Low organic traffic and minimal "Share of Voice" for valuable keywords.
* **Conversion Barrier:** High impressions but low capture of high-intent local leads.

---

## 🛠️ The Strategy: "AI + Human Touch"
I implemented a forward-thinking framework that prioritizes **Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)** to ensure the brand serves as the primary "source of truth" for both Google and AI agents.

### 1. AEO Content Mapping
* Leveraged **Claude** and **Gemini** to identify and cluster high-intent question queries.
* Mapped "Problem-Solution" content to capture users at the top of the funnel.

### 2. Semantic & Technical Optimization
* Utilized **Clearscope** to ensure long-form content (e.g., "Best Air Con Brands in Australia") was perfectly optimized for search intent.
* Executed all on-page and technical updates directly within **WordPress** using **AISEO**. 

### 3. Local SEO & Authority
* Ensured 100% NAP consistency across AU-specific directories via **BrightLocal**.
* Engineered location-specific pages to dominate the Toowoomba market.
